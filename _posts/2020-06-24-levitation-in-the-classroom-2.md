Check out the acoustic levitator in action! I was only levitating a small piece of styrofoam in this case, but it's a promising start!

I was able to get to school the other day and had a chance to fiddle with my levitator.  It looks like it is still working, but I need to get out my multimeter and maybe tweak some things. Looks like I should be able to use it in class this year!

I didn't have some tweezers so I used some wire gauze from chemistry.  Since it is a mesh, it interferes less with the sound waves than something solid like a piece of cardboard or an index card.
