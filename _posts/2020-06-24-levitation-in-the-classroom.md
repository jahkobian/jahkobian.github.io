Waves show up in nature all over the place, but the most interesting ones are invisible.  One of my challenges in teaching 7th grade science is creating up-close and personal connections for students as they try to wrap their minds around the models we convince them to believe in even though they can't directly hold and look at the phenomena the models address. Sound waves have been one of those difficult areas.  You can show the compression wave in a slinky, draw air molecules with regions of compression and rarefaction, and watch cool youtube videos, but I may have found something better: [an acoustic levitator](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.4989995 "the original scientific publication")

The device is called TinyLev by its makers, and it uses two arrays of ultrasonic transducers (speakers) to create a standing wave.  A standing wave has nodes where the air is not moving which allows low density materials to become trapped there. I was able to build my own by referencing [this instructables](https://www.instructables.com/id/Acoustic-Levitator/).
