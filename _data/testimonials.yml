  testimonial: "I was struggling in AP Biology so one of my friends referred Jacob to me. Jacob had never taught AP Biology but he worked very hard to learn and then to help me learn what I was not understanding. He helped me pass the class and I am very thankful for him to take time out of his day to help tutor me."
